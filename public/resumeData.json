He has great analytical skills and he makes sure that he has the complete picture of the solution before running into implementation, which, I think, helps him to do things right in the first place. He is very proactive and his knowledge of latest tools and technologies available in the market has been of great help for the team. I am also impressed with the way he had managed intense technical debates. He is also highly collaborative and very easy to get along. It has been a pleasure to work with him. I'd highly recommend him as I think he is a great asset to any software development team.",
